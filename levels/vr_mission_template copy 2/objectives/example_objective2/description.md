# Use The Model
You have a model that has been trained to learn the relationship between X and Y. You can use the model.predict method to have it figure out the Y for a previously unknown X. For example, if X is 10, what do you think Y will be? Take a guess before you run the following code:
```py
print(model.predict([10.0]))
```
