  "description": "Consider the following sets of numbers. Can you see the relationship between them? X: -1,   0,   1,   2,   3,   4    Y: -2,   1,   4,   7,   10 , 13. As you look at them, you might notice that the value of X is increasing by 1 as you read left to right and the corresponding value of Y is increasing by 3. You probably think that Y equals 3X plus or minus something. Then, you'd probably look at the 0 on X and see that Y is 1, and you'd come up with the relationship Y=3X+1. That's almost exactly how you would use code to train a model to spot the patterns in the data! Now, look at the code to do it. (in the next tab). And, once you're done, hit HACK!",
