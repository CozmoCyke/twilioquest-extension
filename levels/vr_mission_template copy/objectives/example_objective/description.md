# What is ML?

Machine Learning in layman terms, is teaching a computer to learn based on experience.

In traditional programming, you write rules for the computer to follow. Then, the computer acts on data and your program provides answers. 

In machine learning, instead of trying to define the rules and express them in a programming language, you provide the answers (typically called labels) along with the data, and the machine infers the rules that determine the relationship between the answers and data.
